As a protective measure, we decided to add a vesting mechanism (for up to 12 months) that locks the tokens in a smart contract, in order to avoid dumping and potential price manipulation. We plan to list on the Maiar DEX so users can for example be able to swap and create a staking pool. Those who own at least 1 Chain Legacy NFT will be able to invest at a discount. The presale starts in June, after the release of the generative collection. Stay tuned for more details about $LEGACY!"
